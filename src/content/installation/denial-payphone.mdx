# Overview

On June 30th, my collaborator Laila called me with an idea for an interactive payphone, ominously installed underneath a billboard.

## How It Works

1. **Phone Call**: Users dial the number and are connected to the payphone
2. **Keyword Detection**: The Raspberry Pi listens for specific keywords using Vosk
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Python scripts analyze the emotional content of conversations
4. **Billboard Response**: The system triggers responses based on detected patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware Setup
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Main processing unit for audio analysis
- **USB Audio Interface**: High-quality audio input/output
- **Cellular Modem**: Connects the payphone to the phone network
- **Weather Protection**: Enclosure rated for outdoor installation

### Software Architecture
- **Vosk Speech Recognition**: Real-time speech-to-text processing
- **Python Audio Processing**: Custom scripts for keyword detection
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural language processing for emotional context
- **Data Logging**: Secure storage of interaction patterns (anonymized)

## Installation Process

The payphone was strategically placed in Echo Park, Los Angeles, underneath a billboard to create an ominous and thought-provoking presence. The installation required:

- Permits for public art installation
- Coordination with billboard advertising company
- Weatherproofing and security measures
- Network connectivity setup

## Billboard Campaign

15 billboards across Los Angeles were purchased to direct people to the payphone location, creating a city-wide interactive art experience that blurred the lines between digital and physical space.

## Impact

The Denial Payphone created a unique intersection of technology, public art, and social commentary. By analyzing conversations for keywords and sentiment, it raised questions about privacy, surveillance, and the emotional landscape of urban communication.
