# Project Overview

<ul className="list-disc ml-6 pl-1">
    <li>
        A Raspberry Pi powered interactive payphone, installed in front of a vintage store in Echo Park, LA.

    <li>
        15 billboards were deployed in the LA area to direct users to the payphone location. A Twilio backend serves an audio recording when the number is called.

    <li>
        An in-house analytics dashboard monitors call volume, and manages a database of captured phone numbers from Twilio.

    <li>
        Uses [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), an open-source **speech-to-text** package for real-time offline transcription.

    <li>
        Uses a [Bag-of-words](https://victorzhou.com/blog/bag-of-words/) approach powered by [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) to run **sentiment analysis** and give uses different respones based on their input.

# The Mission

On June 30, 2025, my collaborator [Laila Smith](https://www.instagram.com/lailasmith/) called me with an idea for an interactive Raspberry Pi powered payphone, ominously installed underneath a billboard.

<img src="/images/installation/content/denial-payphone/denial_payphone_original_idea.png" className="max-w-3xl w-full py-2" />

Originally, the idea was to put one payphone underneath the billboard, and two in other locations in Los Angeles. We quickly ran into the problem of how to procure **reliable power** and **Wi-Fi**. After testing out a solar panel + generator setup and musing upon portable Wi-Fi hotspots, we refined the idea to a single payphone installed in the alcove of our friend Michael's vintage store in Echo Park. 

One problem: there was no Wi-Fi at Michael's store, which meant any speech-to-text or sentiment analysis would need to run locally. 

I fineagled my way into some time off work, and spent the next few weeks writing Python, taking way too many trips to Microcenter, learning to solder, and getting knee-deep in open-source transcription models.
