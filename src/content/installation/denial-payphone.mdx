# The Mission

On June 30, 2025, my collaborator Laila called me with an idea for an interactive Raspberry Pi powered payphone, ominously installed underneath a billboard.

Originally, the idea was to put one payphone underneath the billboard, and two in other locations in Los Angeles. We quickly ran into the problem of how to procure **reliable power** and **Wi-Fi**. After testing out a solar panel + generator setup and musing upon portable Wi-Fi hotspots, we refined the idea to a single payphone installed in the alcove of our friend Michael's vintage store in Echo Park. 

One problem: there was (and is) no Wi-Fi at Michael's store, which meant any speech-to-text or sentiment analysis would need to run locally.
