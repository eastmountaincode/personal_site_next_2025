# Project Overview

<ul className="list-disc ml-6 pl-1">
    <li>
        A virtual free little library, for mp3s, pdfs, gifs, 3d models, videos, epubs, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Downloading a file deletes it from the box, making room for another file.
    </li>
</ul>

# Concept

I wanted to create a place people could go to find something spontaneously, and wonder about the person who put the file there. So much of what I love is in files, so I wanted to bring the experience of a lending library to the digital realm.

# PVFLL 001

PVFLL 001 is the physical manifestation of the virtual free little library. It has an e-ink display that shows the state of the boxes, and runs on a Raspberry Pi. It lives in a cardboard chassis for now.

I like to take PVFLL 001 along to house parties and other events as an activation of the space. One day I'd like to find a permanent home for this one, and I'd like to continue making these so that anyone that wants one can have one for their community space.
